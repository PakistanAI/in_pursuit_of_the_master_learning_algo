# In Pursuit Of The Master Learning Algo

This repository stores the resources of a think tank and research group exploring the possible avenues of a Master Learning algorithm. To communicate with the think thank please register [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScy5Jy3qobjaybX4RIOEHPe47lrh27UlxaZyk18JmntgTv-qQ/viewform) and you will be included in the Google Group communications.

#### [The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning-Machine/dp/0465094279/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1539887696&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Master+Algorithm)
##### By Pedro Domingos
**Description**: In the world's top research labs and universities, the race is on to invent the ultimate learning algorithm: one capable of discovering any knowledge from data, and doing anything we want, before we even ask. In The Master Algorithm, Pedro Domingos lifts the veil to give us a peek inside the learning machines that power Google, Amazon, and your smartphone. He assembles a blueprint for the future universal learner--the Master Algorithm--and discusses what it will mean for business, science, and society. If data-ism is today's philosophy, this book is its bible.    
**Think Thank Perspective**: This book delivers the idea of what is a master learning algorithm, why is it important and what attempts have been made until now to achieve it
